# findNumber
inspired by numberphile video: [youtube - numberphile -> number 277777788888899](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wim9WJeDTHQ)

This program will find number of specified multiplication persistance (MP).
By multiplication persistance I mean that for example if your number is "923" ... it has
1) 9 * 2 * 3 = 54
2) 5 * 4 = 20
3) 2 * 0 = 0
.. MP of 3.
In this program you must specify MP and program returns first number of that specified MP.

For example:
```
go run number.go 4 // find and print number 77
```

keep in mind that biggest found multi. is 11 (number 277777788888899) [youtube/numberphile/277777788888899](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wim9WJeDTHQ)
so if you want to find for example 10 it will take several minutes ...
